Your responsibility, as a project manager, is to control that all three elements of the
triangle are in sync: when one of them changes you have to change the other two. If you don't
know how much the project will cost, how long will take, or how much functionality
it will implement---you are not a project manager.

\pmbaQuestion
  {Even though it was not required by the customer, a programmer suggests to implement an additional feature in the product, because it is obvious that users will love it; what do you say, as a PM?}
  {Definitely, not!}
  {Maybe we should discuss with the customer first?}
  {Only if it doesn't delay all other features}
  {Sure, customer first!}
  {gold-platting}

\pmbaQuestion
  {Which one is the right formulation of a functionality in a Use Case?}
  {User \emph{can} download a picture}
  {User \emph{downloads} a picture}
  {User \emph{will} download a picture}
  {User \emph{should} download a picture}
  {use-case}

\pmbaQuestion
  {A customer asks you how much work is left to be done. Where do you find this information?}
  {I ask my team}
  {Use Cases}
  {Backlog}
  {Traceability Matrix}
  {scope-control}

\pmbaQuestion
  {Which one \emph{isn't} a Non-Functional Requirement (NFR)?}
  {When ``Send'' is clicked, email must be sent in less than 500ms}
  {The ``Settings'' page must be intuitively easy to use}
  {A picture of 100Kb downloads in less than 1.5s}
  {In case of a security breach at any web server, user passwords won't leak}
  {use-case}

\pmbaQuestion
  {A project of one year and five programmers can be decomposed into how many Work Packages?}
  {I don't know}
  {Seven}
  {25 sprints, 5 coders, 1 WPs per week \(\to\) 250 WPs}
  {Hundreds}
  {use-case}

\pmbaQuestion
  {Which estimate of project scope is the most reasonable?}
  {300,000 Hits of Code in the repository}
  {100 Function Points implemented}
  {500 Pull Requests merged}
  {50,000 Lines of Code written}
  {estimate}
