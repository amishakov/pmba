\begin{abstract}
Today, Agile has emerged as a widely-used term among managers overseeing software development projects. Nonetheless, it's important to note that Agile is not a management framework per se, but rather a set of guiding principles intended for managers already utilizing an established framework, such as IBM's RUP\REG{} or Microsoft's MSF\REG{}. Furthermore, the PMBOKâ„¢ by PMI\REG{} posits that project management is a deterministic endeavor, regulated by stringent rules and even laws. This course seeks to form a connection between the traditionally dry formalism of project management and the progressive practices of Agile/XP.
\end{abstract}

% \section*{Introduction}

\textbf{What is the goal?}\\
The main aim of this course is to enable students to comprehend the core principles of project management as outlined by PMBOK\TM{}. It further encourages them to implement these principles in practical scenarios, particularly in commercial and open-source software development projects.

\textbf{Who is the teacher?}\\
Yegor is developing software for more than 30 years, being a hands-on programmer
(see his GitHub account: \href{https://github.com/yegor256}{@yegor256})
and a manager of other programmers. At the moment, he is a director
of an R\&D laboratory in Huawei. His recent conference talks are in
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q}{his YouTube channel}.
He also published a \href{https://www.yegor256.com/books.html}{few books}
and wrote a \href{https://www.yegor256.com/contents.html}{blog} about software engineering
and OOP.
He previously taught a few courses in
Innopolis University (Kazan, Russia)
and HSE University (Moscow, Russia),
for example,
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/ssd16}{SSD16 (2021)},
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/eqsp}{EQSP (2022)},
and
\href{https://github.com/yegor256/ppa}{PPA (2023)}
(all videos are available).

\textbf{Why this course?}\\
Agile, viewed as a software development philosophy, can be highly effective when applied by those well-versed in essential project management principles, such as scope, cost, and risk management. However, as Agile's popularity rises, there's an observed decline in the understanding of project management as a scientific discipline, a trend noted among both new graduates and experienced software engineers and managers. This course aims to enhance such understanding, minimizing the tedium typically associated with traditional management disciplines.

\textbf{What's the methodology?}\\
Each lecture engages in an analysis of several practical scenarios within a software development team. The aim is to discern both productive and unproductive situations. From these observations, conclusions are drawn that help students gain a clearer understanding and improved perspective of their own management decisions.

\section*{Grading}

Students have to form groups of 2--4 people in each one.

Each group should pick a research topic from the list suggested by the teacher
at the first lecture. A group is allowed to pick its own topic, if approved
by the teacher at the first lecture.

Each group should do a research and write a research paper, according
to this \href{https://www.yegor256.com/2022/08/24/research-paper-template.html}{recommendation}.
The length of the pager may be no longer than four pages
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/acmart}{acmart/sigplan} format (two columns).

Before the end of the course, the paper must be submitted
to \href{http://www.icse-conferences.org/}{ICSE} or
\href{https://www.esec-fse.org/}{ESEC/FSE} conference
(student tracks and workshops are allowed).
The paper may be submitted only after the teacher approves it.

There is no exam at the end of the course. Instead, the quality of the paper
will be \emph{subjectively} evaluated by the teacher.

The attendance is tracked at the lectures. If 75\% of all lectures were attended,
it guarantees ``C'' (otherwise ignored).
