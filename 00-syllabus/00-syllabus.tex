{\sffamily{\bfseries\Large Project Management Beyond Agile}\\
Series of lectures by \href{https://www.yegor256.com}{Yegor Bugayenko}.
The entire set of slide decks is in \href{https://github.com/yegor256/pmba}{yegor256/pmba} GitHub repository.

\begin{abstract}
Today, Agile has emerged as a widely used term among managers overseeing software development projects.
However, Agile is not a management framework per se.
Instead, it is a set of guiding principles intended for managers already utilizing an established framework, such as IBM's RUP\REG{} or Microsoft's MSF\REG{}.
The PMBOKâ„¢ by PMI\REG{} posits that project management is a deterministic endeavor, regulated by stringent rules and even laws.
This course seeks to bridge the traditionally dry formalism of project management and the progressive practices of Agile/XP.
\end{abstract}

\textbf{What is the goal?}\\
The main aim of this course is to enable students to comprehend the core principles of project management as outlined by PMBOK\TM{}.
The course encourages them to implement these principles in practical scenarios, particularly in commercial and open-source software development projects.

\textbf{Who is the teacher?}\\
Yegor has been developing software for more than 30 years.
He is a hands-on programmer (see his GitHub account: \href{https://github.com/yegor256}{@yegor256}) and a manager of other programmers.
At the moment, he is a software developer in Huawei.
His recent conference talks are in \href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr9qCdqXLm2SU0BIs6d_68Q}{his YouTube channel}.
He also published \href{https://www.yegor256.com/books.html}{several books} and wrote a \href{https://www.yegor256.com/contents.html}{blog} about software engineering and OOP.
He previously taught several courses at \href{https://innopolis.university/}{Innopolis University} (Kazan, Russia) and \href{https://hse.ru}{HSE University} (Moscow, Russia). Examples include \href{https://github.com/yegor256/sqm}{SQM}, \href{https://github.com/yegor256/eqsp}{EQSP}, \href{https://github.com/yegor256/ppa}{PPA}, and \href{https://github.com/yegor256/painofoop}{COOP} (all videos are available).

\textbf{Why this course?}\\
Agile, viewed as a software development philosophy, can be highly effective when applied by those well-versed in essential project management principles, such as scope, cost, and risk management.
However, as Agile's popularity rises, there's an observed decline in the understanding of project management as a scientific discipline.
This trend has been noted among both new graduates and experienced software engineers and managers.
This course aims to enhance such understanding while minimizing the tedium typically associated with traditional management disciplines.

\textbf{What's the methodology?}\\
Each lecture analyzes several practical scenarios within a software development team.
The aim is to discern both productive and unproductive situations.
From these observations, conclusions are drawn to help students gain a clearer understanding and improved perspective of their own management decisions.

\section*{Grading}

To pass the course, students must attend lectures and earn points by contributing to any of these open-source projects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://github.com/objectionary/lints}{\ff{objectionary/lints}} (Java + XSLT)
    \item \href{https://github.com/cqfn/aibolit}{\ff{cqfn/aibolit}} (Python)
    \item \href{https://github.com/objectionary/eoc}{\ff{objectionary/eoc}} (JavaScript)
    \item \href{https://github.com/yegor256/0rsk}{\ff{yegor256/0rsk}} (Ruby)
    \item \href{https://github.com/objectionary/reo}{\ff{objectionary/reo}} (Rust)
\end{itemize}

There is no oral or written exam at the end of the course. Instead, each student earns points for the following results:

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
Result & Points & Limit \\
\midrule
Attended a lecture & +1 & 6 \\
Submitted a ticket (that was accepted) & +2 & 8 \\
Submitted a pull request (that was merged) & +4 & 32 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

Final grades are based on accumulated points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 25+ earns an ``A,''
    \item 17+ a ``B,''
    and
    \item 9+ a ``C.''
\end{itemize}

If eight or fewer points are accumulated during the course, the student may still earn them before the retake.

An online lecture is counted as ``attended'' only if a student was personally present in Zoom for more than 75\% of the lecture's time.
Watching the lecture from a friend's computer \emph{doesn't} count.
