\pmbaQuestion
  {What is the cost of a risk, if \emph{probability} is 0.8, \emph{impact} is 0.7, and \emph{effect} is \pounds1,000?}
  {\pounds1,500}
  {\pounds560}
  {\pounds800}
  {\pounds700}

\pmbaQuestion
  {At a technical meeting, a programmer says: "I think the use of this framework will lead to problems in the future". What do you answer?}

\pmbaQuestion
  {The estimated duration of the project is 20 months. There is a \emph{3x9} risk that a few key engineers may leave the company soon. If this happens, the project will be delayed by another 15 months. What project duration you should report now to the customer?}
  {\(20 + 15 \times 0.3 = 24.5\)}

  {Ask him to pay \$5K upfront, refund later}
  {Put \$5K into contingency reserve}
  {Put \$5K into management reserve}
  {Put \$2.5K into project budget}
  {reserves}

  ``\emph{Risk Register} is a document in which the results of risk analysis and risk response planning
  are recorded. It contains the outcomes of the other risk management processes as they are
  conducted, resulting in an increase in the level and type of information contained in the
  risk register over time.'' --- PMBOK5
