  \pptBanner{Homework:}
  A ``project estimate'' refers to a systematic assessment of the anticipated time, resources, and costs required to complete a specific project. It is derived from a detailed understanding of the project's scope, tasks, and potential challenges, and serves as a foundational tool for budgeting, scheduling, and resource allocation. Accurate project estimates are crucial for setting realistic expectations and ensuring the project's successful completion within its defined constraints.
